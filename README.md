## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This project presents a MATLAB-based system for detecting kidney stones from ultrasound images using advanced image processing techniques such as:
- Image preprocessing and enhancement  
- Segmentation using morphological analysis  
- Wavelet-based feature extraction  
- Neural network-based classification

The model achieved  **97% classification accuracy**.

## ðŸ§  Methodology Overview

1. **Preprocessing:** Noise reduction and image enhancement of ultrasound scans.  
2. **Segmentation:** Morphological analysis to isolate potential stone regions.  
3. **Feature Extraction:** Wavelet-based statistical features extracted for classification.  
4. **Classification:** Neural network trained to distinguish stone presence and absence.  

> The pipeline was implemented in **MATLAB**, leveraging built-in functions for image filtering, segmentation, and feature analysis.
